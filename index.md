I'm a **doctoral candidate** at the [Helmholtz Zentrum München](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/computational-health-center) and [Technische Universität München](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/). I'm also part of [MUDS](https://www.mu-ds.de) and [HELENA](https://cams.helmholtz-munich.de/helena).

My research interests include inverse problems in **computational microscopy**, **image generation** and **image reconstruction**, and self-supervised and unsupervised learning. The focus of my work is to create and refine imaging techniques that will lead to better image quality, facilitating progress in the biomedical field.

🚨 Currently, I'm available to supervise driven students, offering thesis topics for both bachelor's and master's degrees in the fields of image processing and restoration with the focus on biomedical imaging.

## Education & previous projects

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my master's degree in Data Engineering and Analytics from TUM. 

*Additionally, I had the opportunity to contribute to several projects that involve:*
* [Privacy-preserving machine learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605764.3623906)
* [Transfer learning](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v140/chobola21a)
* Statistical modeling

I was also fortunate to spend time at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
