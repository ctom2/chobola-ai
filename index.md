I am a **doctoral candidate** at the [Helmholtz Zentrum München](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/computational-health-center) and [Technische Universität München](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/).

*My research interests include:* 
* Inverse problems in **computational microscopy**
* **Image generation** and **image reconstruction**
* Self-supervised and unsupervised learning

My mission is to develop new techniques that improve image quality, paving the way for advancements in biomedical research.

I am also part of [MUDS](https://www.mu-ds.de) and [HELENA](https://cams.helmholtz-munich.de/helena).

## Education & previous projects

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my master's degree in Data Engineering and Analytics from TUM. 

*Additionally, I had the opportunity to contribute to several projects that involve:*
* [Privacy-preserving machine learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605764.3623906)
* [Transfer learning](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v140/chobola21a)
* Statistical modeling

I was also fortunate to spend time at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
